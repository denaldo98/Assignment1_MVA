# PCA, CA, MCA in *R*
Assignment realized for the course *Multivariate Analysis* at *Universitat Polit√®cnica de Catalunya*. 
 
 Implementation of Factor Analysis  methods in *R*:
 
 - Principal Component Analysis (PCA), performed on the `cars2004.csv` dataset
 - Correspondence Analysis (CA), performed on the `mortality` dataset, already available in *R*
 - Multiple Correspondence Analysis (MCA), performed on the `bicing.csv` dataset.

Each FA method is implemented according to the following steps:

 1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), through which we explore and prepare the dataset
 
 2. Application of the FA method
 3. Visualizations and results interpretation

The project is entirely realized using the [R](https://www.r-project.org/) language.

For each method we built a `Rmd` file: `PCA.Rmd`, `CA.Rmd`, `MCA.Rmd`. We include in this repository also the *.html* files generated from the above mentioned notebooks, one for each FA method.

More details about the followed steps are described in the [report](https://github.com/denaldo98/Assignment1_MVA/blob/main/report.pdf) file.
